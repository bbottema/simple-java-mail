v5.0.0 (14-Februari-2018)

New features
- #116 You can now test the connection to the SMTP server
- #115 Create mailers with a very robust MailerBuilder API, able to ignore defaults as well

emails.
- #107 You can now easily forward or reply to emails!

Maintenance updates

Complete JavaDoc overhaul. Navigating the JavaDoc should be much more consistent now (builder API being the single *public* source of truth).

- #122 The email-rfc2822-validator library has been made a proper Maven dependency (not packaged along anymore)
- #120 The DKIM library has been made an optional proper Maven dependency (not packaged along anymore)
- #119 Switched optional Spring dependency version to property and now testing with 4.3.11.RELEASE
- #113 Updated the underlying JavaMail to 1.6.0

Security updates
- #111 Protocol properties for SMTPS are now applied properly
- #105 SMTP tries to upgrade to TLS while SMTP_TLS now enforces it and for both SMTP_TLS and SMTPS, mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity is set
to true (https://javaee.github.io/javamail/docs/api/com/sun/mail/smtp/package-summary.html)

Bugfixes
- #110 Trusted hosts should be space-delimited
- #109 Email headers should be allowed to be empty (now conversion errors can occur as well)
- #103 Converting to MimeMessage results in an invalid Content-Disposition for attachments


v4.4.5 (2-September-2017)

- #101 API backwards compatibility update, reinstate old addRecipient API as deprecated (sorry for removing it abruptly)


v4.4.4 (21-August-2017)

API usability release. *This relase streamlined the recipient setters, breaking backwards compatibility (but straightforward to fix)*

- #95 Feature: Add support native API for setting Return-Receipt-To header
- #93 Feature: Add support native API for setting Disposition-Notification-To header
- #91 *Feature: Add support for parsing preformatted email addresses that include both name and address*
- #94 Bugfix: A single EmailBuilder would build emails that all share the same collections for recipients, attachments and embedded images
- #98 Bugfix: Subject and body content should be optional

v4.3.0 (12-August-2017)

Security and timeout release.

This version safeguards against SMTP injection attack from external values entering the library through *Email* instance. Also, this release
introduces default/configurable timeouts for connecting, reading and writing when sending an email.

- #89 Support multiple delimited recipient addresses sharing the same TO/CC/BCC name
- #88 Safeguard subject property (and others) against SMTP CRLF injection attacks
- #85 Apply configurable timeouts when sending emails
- #83 Parse INLINE attachments without ID as regular attachments when converting (mostly applicable to Apple emails)


v4.2.3 (21-May-2017)

- #79: Enhancement: define custom message ID on the Email object
- #74: v4.2.3-java-6-release: A java6 version with limited capabilities:
    I've released a customised java6 release with a customised outlook-message-parser 1.1.16-java6-release. This is the last java6 release I will do,
     as it is simply too much manual labor to create a limited second edition.

    For this edition, I've removed the JDK7 Phaser completely which has the following consequences:

    - If authenticated proxy is used, the bridging proxy server will not be shut down automatically (and might not run the second time)
    - If mails are sent in async mode, the connection pool will not be shut down anymore by itself

    This means your server/application might not stop properly due to lingering processes. To be completely safe, only send emails in sync mode (used by default) and don't use authenticated proxy config.


v4.2.2 (10-May-2017)

- #73: Patch: fix for sending emails in async mode, which makes sure the connection pool is always closed when the last *known* email has been sent. Without
this fix, the connection pool keeps any parent process running (main thread or Tomcat for example) until a hard kill.


v4.2.1 (12-Feb-2017)

Patch: streamlined convenience methods for adding recipients.


v4.2.0 (12-Feb-2017)

Major feature: Using the EmailConverter you can now convert between Outlook .msg, EML, MimeMessage and Email!

- #66: Feature: convert email to EML
- #65: Feature: read outlook messages from .msg file
- #64: Feature: Added support for logging-only mode that skips the actual sending of emails
- #63: Feature: Already including in previous patch update: Spring support (read properties from Spring context)
- #69: Enhancement: Expanded EmailBuilder API to inlude more options for setting (multiple) recipients
- #70: Enhancement: Most public API now have defensive null-checks for required fields (Fail Fast support)
- #68: Bugfix: Name should be required for embedded images (added safeguards)
- #67: Bugfix: Error when name was omitted for attachment
- minor: added methods on AttachmentResource that reads back the content as (encoded) String
- other: internal testing is now done using Wiser SMTP test server for testing live sending emails

Note: Starting this release, there will always be a Java6 compatible release as well versioned: "x.y.z-java6-release"
