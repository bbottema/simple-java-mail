The core library is now even smaller compared to the 5.x.x series going from 183kb to 134kb!

- [CLI support!!](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/156),
- major performance improvement with [advanced batch processing](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/214) including support for mail server clusters.

- 6.0.0 also includes support for [S/MIME signed and encrypted emails](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/187)!
- All 3rd party dependencies have been made optional by splitting up Simple Java Mail into easy to use [modules](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/183).
- You can now monitor and [handle async processing](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/148) using Futures.
- MimeMessage results are now [structurally matched](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/144) to specific needs (only using alternative/mixed etc. when needed)

Maintenance updates

Complete JavaDoc overhaul. Navigating the JavaDoc should be much more consistent now (builder API being the single *public* source of truth).

Bugfixes

v4.4.5 (2-September-2017)

- #101 API backwards compatibility update, reinstate old addRecipient API as deprecated (sorry for removing it abruptly)


v4.4.4 (21-August-2017)

API usability release. *This relase streamlined the recipient setters, breaking backwards compatibility (but straightforward to fix)*

- #95 Feature: Add support native API for setting Return-Receipt-To header
- #93 Feature: Add support native API for setting Disposition-Notification-To header
- #91 *Feature: Add support for parsing preformatted email addresses that include both name and address*
- #94 Bugfix: A single EmailBuilder would build emails that all share the same collections for recipients, attachments and embedded images
- #98 Bugfix: Subject and body content should be optional

v4.3.0 (12-August-2017)

Security and timeout release.

This version safeguards against SMTP injection attack from external values entering the library through *Email* instance. Also, this release
introduces default/configurable timeouts for connecting, reading and writing when sending an email.

- #89 Support multiple delimited recipient addresses sharing the same TO/CC/BCC name
- #88 Safeguard subject property (and others) against SMTP CRLF injection attacks
- #85 Apply configurable timeouts when sending emails
- #83 Parse INLINE attachments without ID as regular attachments when converting (mostly applicable to Apple emails)


v4.2.3 (21-May-2017)

- #79: Enhancement: define custom message ID on the Email object
- #74: v4.2.3-java-6-release: A java6 version with limited capabilities:
    I've released a customised java6 release with a customised outlook-message-parser 1.1.16-java6-release. This is the last java6 release I will do,
     as it is simply too much manual labor to create a limited second edition.

    For this edition, I've removed the JDK7 Phaser completely which has the following consequences:

    - If authenticated proxy is used, the bridging proxy server will not be shut down automatically (and might not run the second time)
    - If mails are sent in async mode, the connection pool will not be shut down anymore by itself

    This means your server/application might not stop properly due to lingering processes. To be completely safe, only send emails in sync mode (used by default) and don't use authenticated proxy config.


v4.2.2 (10-May-2017)

- #73: Patch: fix for sending emails in async mode, which makes sure the connection pool is always closed when the last *known* email has been sent. Without
this fix, the connection pool keeps any parent process running (main thread or Tomcat for example) until a hard kill.


v4.2.1 (12-Feb-2017)

Patch: streamlined convenience methods for adding recipients.


v4.2.0 (12-Feb-2017)

- #64: Feature: Added support for logging-only mode that skips the actual sending of emails
- #63: Feature: Already including in previous patch update: Spring support (read properties from Spring context)
- #69: Enhancement: Expanded EmailBuilder API to inlude more options for setting (multiple) recipients
- #70: Enhancement: Most public API now have defensive null-checks for required fields (Fail Fast support)
- #68: Bugfix: Name should be required for embedded images (added safeguards)
- #67: Bugfix: Error when name was omitted for attachment
- minor: added methods on AttachmentResource that reads back the content as (encoded) String
- other: internal testing is now done using Wiser SMTP test server for testing live sending emails

Note: Starting this release, there will always be a Java6 compatible release as well versioned: "x.y.z-java6-release"


v4.1.3 (28-Jan-2017)
