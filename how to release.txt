Prerequisite:

You need GPG installed (comes along with GIT installation in the \bin folder) and you need to create a keyring, used for signing artifacts.
If you have an existing key, simply import it:

gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import <keyring>.gpg

That, or you can install one of the binaries to import the key, from here: https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html

To release through CI/CD pipeline in CircleCI

 1. update release notes and github readme page and push changes
 2. go to the CI/CD pipeline https://circleci.com/gh/bbottema/simple-java-mail
 3. select the version release needed

To release manually:

 1. update release notes and github readme page (don't commit)
 2. remove SNAPSHOT version from the <version> property
 4. mvn -DperformRelease=true clean deploy
            (set password in settings.xml or use local pgp key password, for which the public key must have been sent to a public key server,
            eg: gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys 05AC6403)
		    server needed in settings.xml (see below)
 5. Go to https://oss.sonatype.org and release the artifact so it is submitted to Maven Central
 6. add new SNAPSHOT version to the <version> property, execute and commit everything

    maven's settings.xml:

        <server>
          <id>ossrh</id>
          <username>sonatype user</username>
          <password>sonatype password</password>
        </server>

    To have a global gpg password so that it will use that automatically:

        <profiles>
            <profile>
                <id>gpg</id>
                <properties>
                    <gpg.executable>gpg</gpg.executable>
                    <gpg.passphrase>password</gpg.passphrase>
                </properties>
            </profile>
        </profiles>
        <activeProfiles>
            <activeProfile>gpg</activeProfile>
        </activeProfiles>
